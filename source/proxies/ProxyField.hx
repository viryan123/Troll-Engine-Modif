/* 
    I'm gonna have to do some changes to NoteField to allow this to happen, but
    The idea is that ProxyField would be more optimized to use en masse compared to NoteFields, as this'd just copy what the field draws, rather than getting every pos etc itself
    Just need to figure out how I'm gonna write it tho
    chances are what i'd have to do is have some sorta "NotefieldManager" which'd handle drawing notefields in specific
    and it'd be put into 2 phases
    pre-draw and draw
    pre-draw grabs all the notes from the playfield its linked to, gets the position they'd be drawn at, etc. This'd store all the drawing info into an array in the notefield
    draw goes through the list of every NoteField and ProxyField and draws them. for ProxyFields, it just grabs the info from its linked NoteField, and for NoteFields it just uses its own info
    this shouldnt be too bad? esp. since PlayFields/NoteFields should only be used in PlayState
